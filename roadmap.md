# Moji Roadmap

Short, focused milestones to keep Moji minimal and smooth while growing power features over time.

## Guiding Principles

- Minimal UI, fast interaction, low cognitive load.
- Workspaces separate context, not just data.
- Tasks are actionable, notes are quick memory, pages evolve ideas.

## 0.1 — Foundation (current)

- Polished UI and consistent layout rhythm.
- Strong onboarding via default workspaces and welcome content.
- Reliable core CRUD for tasks, notes, pages, and workspaces.

## 0.2 — Workflow Boost

- Command Center (Ctrl+P) for global actions.
- Quick add for tasks and notes from anywhere.
- Better search, filters, and tagging flow.
- **Moji Daily** — Calendar-based daily planning system.
  - Daily view for tasks and notes organized by date.
  - Calendar navigation (today, week, month views).
  - Auto-cleanup of completed items after N days.
  - Direct creation of daily tasks and notes.

## 0.3 — Power + Automation

- CLI for Moji (create, list, edit, sync).
- Workspace/page templates.
- Import/export for tasks, notes, and pages.
- **Moji Daily Sync** — Bidirectional integration between Daily and Workspaces.
  - Push items from Daily to Workspaces.
  - `/daily` command in workspace pages/todos to send items to Daily.
  - Smart linking and conflict resolution.

## 0.4 — Collaboration + Business

- Team workspaces with roles.
- Subscriptions and billing.
- Usage insights and performance reporting.

## Icebox

- Public sharing for selected pages.
- Advanced editor blocks (tables, embeds).
- Offline-first sync.
